    <h3>How to make lemonade.</h3>
    <p>Lemonade is easy to make, but getting the ratios right is critical. Too much lemon and it’s too tart and undrinkable, and too much water and it’s, well, watered down. What I’m sharing today is a perfectly balanced lemonade recipe that everyone is going to love.</p>
    

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup of lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 cup of sugar</li>
        <li>6 cups of water <em>divided</em></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Combine 1 cup (236ml) water and 1 cup sugar in a small saucepan. Place over medium-low heat and stir until sugar is dissolved. Remove from heat and set aside, allow to cool for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour 1 cup fresh-squeezed lemon juice into a pitcher. Add sugar/water mixture (simple syrup).</li>
        <li>Add remaining 5 cups (1180ml) water and stir well. Pour over ice and serve, or transfer to refrigerator and allow to chill several hours before serving.</li>
    </ol>

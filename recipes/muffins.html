    <h3>How to make blueberry muffins.</h3>
    <p>Muffins are probably one of the trickiest recipes for me to test. Mainly because I’m VERY picky about them! They have to bake tall with a moist consistency and tons of flavor, which is something difficult to achieve. Luckily, the process of making blueberry muffins is very easy! So while testing takes a while, once it’s nailed down its quick to whip up a batch. There are three main steps:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Dry Ingredients – This includes the flour, salt, spices, leaveners, AND sugar! Truly anything that is dry. These are well combined in a large mixing bowl and then the blueberries are tossed in. By coating the blueberries in the dry mixture, the dry coating will prevent the berries from sinking to the bottom of the muffins.</li>
        <li>Wet Ingredients – All of the remaining ingredients are combined in a separate bowl. This is the butter, oil, eggs, extracts, milk, and sour cream. They may not FULLY blend together, but that’s ok. As long as it’s as smooth as possible.</li>
        <li>Combine – Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix to combine. It’s that easy!</li>
    </ol>

    <p>This mixing method is used for most muffin recipes as well as quick breads, cornbread, pancakes, and waffles. The reason is because these batters tend to be rather thick. By limiting the dry and wet mixing to just one go, this reduces the chances of overworking the gluten strands. The end result is a super light and tender muffin!

        <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 pounds ground beef</li>
